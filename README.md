# Ceres DevOps Tech Screen

Thank you for applying to join the Ceres Engineering team!

To serve as a springboard for discussion when we meet with you in real-time, we would you to think through/plan out an approach to a scenario that we can talk through together with you. Your mission: to run a simple, publicly-hosted HTTP service for geospatial map imagery! We have a few details and constraints that we’d like you to be prepared to speak to:

* Use of load balancer to handle spikes of large queries of imagery
* Use of security groups
* Use of containers
* Use of Terraform to reproduce your work for production and test environments
* Logging and monitoring and how you would use that information
* Documentation around your approach
* Incorporation into CI/CD
* Approach to shipping updates to the solution with minimal / no downtime

We want to get an understanding of your experience and your creativity, discuss possible alternative approaches to some of these areas, the related tradeoffs, and what areas might be really easy and what errors might be challenging.

We look forward to talking through this with you!
